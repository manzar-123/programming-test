#Floor Calculator. 

```{python}


# UK floor converter to US

inp = input("Enter your UK Floor ")
usf = int(inp) + 1
print("US floor", usf)

```

#Salary Calculator program:

```{python}
xh = input("Hours: ")
xr = input("Rate: ")
xp = xh * xr

print("Salary is", xp)
```

this will give a string error. You can solve it in multiple ways.
one is to just put int in the input command.
other is to convert these inputs to int separately.
third is to convert them in float. 1st and 3rd are given here.

```{python}

xh = input("Hours: ")
xr = input("Rate: ")
xp = float(xh) * float(xr)

print("Salary is", xp)


```

#Make a true false generating argument with simple maths:

```{python}

q1 = input("5+6= \n")

q2 = input("11-2= \n")

## make sure to convert it from str to int otherwise it will always generate 'False'

q1 = int(q1); q2 = int(q2)

if (q1==11 and q2==9):
     print("True")
else:
     print("False")


```

#Make a true false generating argument with simple syntax fill in the blanks:

```{python}
q1 = input("Finsish this code by correcting the syntax \n\n <body><p> this is a paragraph. ____</body>\n")

q2 = input("complete the code with correct syntax \n\n <img ___='manzar.png' alt=''>")



if (q1=="</p>" and q2=="src"):
     print("True")
else:
     print("False")
```

#Define a program to be called later on.
I will use the same example from above for this chunk.

```{python}

def signal_gen():
  q1 = input("Finsish this code by correcting the syntax \n\n <body><p> this is a paragraph.____</body>\n")
  
  q2 = input("complete the code with correct syntax \n\n <img ___='manzar.png' alt=''>")
  
  
  
  if (q1=="</p>" and q2=="src"):
       print("True")
  else:
       print("False")

## call your function

signal_gen()

```

## Make for loop

```{python}

for n in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:
  print(n)

print("Done")

```

## A bit advanced for loop

```{python}
n= ["manzar", 'joseph', 'aj', 'bp']
for friends in n:
  print("Happy birthday", friends)

print("Done")
```

# find an occurance
we will try to find 3 in some values


```{python}

found = False
print("Before", found)
for value in [4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10,3, 2,9,1,4,1,7,7,7,10,6]:
  if value == 3:
    found = True
    # you can add break here to pause at 3. You can save some processing power
    # break
  print(found, value)
print("After", found)
  
```

# Exercise
Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". once that is enter3e, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. if the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using #try and #except and print an error message and skip to the next number. 

# see the file exercise1.py for codes.
