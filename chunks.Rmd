```{python}


# UK floor converter to US

inp = input("Enter your UK Floor ")
usf = int(inp) + 1
print("US floor", usf)

```
```{python}
# salary calculator

## xh = input("Hours: ")
## xr = input("Rate: ")
## xp = xh * xr

## print("Salary is", xp)



## this will give a string error. You can solve it in multiple ways.
## one is to just put int in the input command.
## other is to convert these inputs to int separately.
## third is to convert them in float. 1st and 3rd are given here.
## comment out first one to run the second here.


xh = input("Hours: ")
xr = input("Rate: ")
xp = float(xh) * float(xr)

print("Salary is", xp)
